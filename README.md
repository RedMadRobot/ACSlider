Slider which designed specially for our [Alarm Clock concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/5054031-Colored-Alarm-Clock-Interface).

<img src="https://github.com/Redmadrobot/ACSlider/blob/master/preview.gif" />

Implemented as a subclass of UIControl. You can set slider title and max value right in Attributes Inspector in Interface Builder, thanks to @IBInspectable. Also you can choose Slider color using Tint Color property. And there is no need to run simulator to see final result â€“ it is fully rendered in storyboard by @IBDesignable.

<br />
